# AstroSound Redux
## AstroSound is getting an overhaul!

**What is AstroSound REDUX?**

AstroSound is my dream music player. It's something that I want to be easy to use, stylish and appealing to the eye, and fully functional. AstroSound REDUX is based around Google's Material Design. With the REDUX, I've decided to start from the ground up, and redesign the entire application to make it cleaner, and less bug ridden.

The screenshot above is of a build that is currently still in development, and is not yet ready to be shipped. Design is subject to change.
